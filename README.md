# Rowy
This application is a Rowing application made with two views - Rower and Trainer. It's made to be a cheaper and more convenient way to track rowing performances, and to allow the trainer to see live data from up to 7 boats at the time.

## Rower View
The rower view gives the rower the most important information; Split per 500 meters, average Split per 500 meters and distance rowed. The rower can start rowing a given distance (500m, 1000m, 2000m), and connect to a trainer so the trainer can see live performances and start competitions.  

## Trainer View
The trainer will get a mirror view of the info from the connected rowers, and can get info from up to 7 boats. The trainer can start competitions (500m, 1000m, 2000m) for all rowers at the same time.
